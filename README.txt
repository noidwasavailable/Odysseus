| Introduction - ODYSSEUS/EduCOSMOS |
+-----------------------------------+
ODYSSEUS/EduCOSMOS is a project for educational purposes to implement a part
of the storage system of ODYSSEUS(*) named ODYSSEUS/COSMOS. It consists of the
following three projects:
   - EduBfM project : We implement the operations of the buffer manager
	 consisting of only a very limited subset of the ODYSSEUS Buffer Manager
	 (BfM) functionality.
   - EduOM project : We implement the operations of page-related structures
	 consisting of only a very limited subset of the ODYSSEUS Object Manager
	 (OM) functionality.
   - EduBtM project : We implement the operations of the B+tree index manager
	 consisting of only a very limited subset of the ODYSSEUS B+tree Manager
	 (BtM) functionality.
To help implement each module, students are provided with the project manual,
which contains the base information of the project, the procedure to follow,
and the header/object files containing data structures and useful APIs.
Students are also provided with the test module to test the functions that
they implement and the executable solution file showing the correct test
result.
Students can learn about the structures and functionality of major modules
of a DBMS through each project manual provided and can learn the DBMS system
programming skill by implementing and testing these modules.

(*)ODYSSEUS
ODYSSEUS is an object-relational DBMS developed by Kyu-Young Whang et al. at 
Advanced Information Technology Research Center (AITrc) / Computer Science 
Department of KAIST. ODYSSEUS has been being developed since 1990. Some
useful references are as listed below.
