 * 
 * Description :
 * (Following description is for original ODYSSEUS/COSMOS OM.
 *  For ODYSSEUS/EduCOSMOS EduOM, refer to the EduOM project manual.)
 *
 *  eduom_CreateObject() creates a new object near the specified object; the near
 *  page is the page holding the near object.
 *  If there is no room in the near page and the near object 'nearObj' is not
 *  NULL, a new page is allocated for object creation (In this case, the newly
 *  allocated page is inserted after the near page in the list of pages
 *  consiting in the file).
 *  If there is no room in the near page and the near object 'nearObj' is NULL,
 *  it trys to create a new object in the page in the available space list. If
 *  fail, then the new object will be put into the newly allocated page(In this
 *  case, the newly allocated page is appended at the tail of the list of pages
 *  cosisting in the file).
 *
 * Returns:
 *  error Code
 *    eBADCATALOGOBJECT_OM
 *    eBADOBJECTID_OM
 *    some errors caused by fuction calls
